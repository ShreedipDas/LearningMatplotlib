# My-first-Matplotlib-project
- This is the record of my learning of Matplotlib and making some graphs.

# Median Developer Salaries by Age
- In this plot, we visualize the salaries of the Python, Javascript developers, and developers in general with ages ranging from 18 to 55.
- While experimenting with styles and grids, I came to like the 'fivethirtyeight' style, the 'ggplot' style, and a special style called the 'xkcd' style that mimics the artstyle of comics.
