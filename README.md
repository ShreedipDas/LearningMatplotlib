# My-first-Matplotlib-project
- This is the record of my learning of Matplotlib and making some graphs.
- This repository will contain the bare and basic projects that I learned.

# Median Developer Salaries by Age
- Based on the 2019 Annual Stack Overflow developer survey, I created a plot showing the salaries of different language developers according to their age.
In this plot, we visualize the salaries of Python, Javascript, and developers in general, whose ages range from 18 to 55.

- While experimenting with styles and grids, I came to like the 'fivethirtyeight' style, the 'ggplot' style, and a special style called the 'xkcd' style that mimics the artstyle of comics.

This is the plot with the 'xkcd' style.

This is the plot with the 'ggplot' style.

![plot 1c](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0810c68f-636a-4e4f-914b-a1c3ad65b0b3)

This is the plot with the 'fivethirtyeight' style.

- I also created a vertical bar chart

# Developers and their Languages
- From the same survey Stack Overflow survey, I am using a CSV file containing the info on around 90,000 developers and the languages they worked with.
- I uploaded the CSV file but here is the link: (https://github.com/ShreedipDas/My-first-Matplotlib-project/blob/main/CSV%20file)
- Since the vertical bar chart would be too crowded, I opted for a horizontal bar chart.
- I read this CSV file through the CSV module on Python as well as used pandas to do the same.

- As you can see, my graph is similar to the graph plotted by the Stack Overflow survey.
